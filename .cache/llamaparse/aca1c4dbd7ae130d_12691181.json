We are committed to providing the highest quality service and assessment. However, as generalists conducting visual-only inspections, some defects may be concealed or not readily apparent—hidden issues may exist in any home.\\n\\n## What is a Home Inspection?\\nA home inspection is a non-invasive, visual examination of the accessible areas of a residential property, performed for a fee. This examination is designed to identify defects within specific systems and components of the home that are both observed and deemed material by the inspector.\\n\\n### Definition of Material Defect\\nA material defect pertains to a particular problem within a system or component of a residential property that could substantially diminish the property's value or present an unreasonable safety risk to occupants. It should be noted that the mere fact that a system or component is approaching, at, or past its typical lifespan does not, on its own, qualify as a material defect.\\n\\n## Standards of Practice\\nThis home inspection is based on the InterNACHI Standards of Practice (SOPs) followed by the Inspector. The SOPs are minimum guidelines that determine what an inspector must and need not inspect and report on. The inspector is free to exceed these guidelines at his discretion; however, comments on systems, components, or conditions that exceed the scope of the general home inspection are not meant to imply that the scope of the inspection is expanded to include all systems, components, or conditions.\\n\\n## Limited Examination\\nPlease understand that an inspection is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive in a technical sense nor are structures classified as \\\"passing\\\" or \\\"failing.\\\" The assessment is derived from an examination of the observable parts of the structure. This home inspection is designed to depict the observable state of the home at the time of the inspection.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- The inspection does not foresee, predict, or ensure future conditions.\\n- Property conditions can undergo significant and substantial changes within only a day or two.\\n- This inspection does not serve as a guarantee or warranty for the home's condition at the time of closing.\\n- Variations between the inspection date and the closing date are not uncommon.\\n- It is common for many sellers to patch, paint, or touch up areas of the structure prior to selling. Recent paint or patching may cover known past defects not detectable by the inspector.\\n\\n## Limitations of the Inspection\\nDue to the temporal constraints, it is impossible to inspect every square inch of every area of a structure within that limited time frame, and therefore not every defect can be anticipated or identified. Inspectors proceed area by area systematically, and if a material defect develops or becomes apparent in an already inspected and cleared area, the inspector is not liable for failing to detect or report such defects.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Note**: The above text is a summary of the inspection report and does not include specific issues, recommendations, safety concerns, or cost estimates as they were not provided in the text. Please refer to the complete inspection report for detailed findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MAVERICK INSPECTION REPORT\\n\\n## General Information\\nThere is no predetermined duration for testing each water fixture. The inspector will run each fixture for the time required to verify the functionality of both hot and cold water supplies. Documentation of leaks is contingent upon their visibility during the operation of each fixture. Predicting future leaks is beyond the scope of this inspection. An inspector cannot ascertain the presence of hidden leaks within walls or ceilings without visible moisture or clear signs of dampness at the time of inspection. This inspection does not extend to verifying the presence or effectiveness of water conservation devices on any fixture.\\n\\n## Generalist\\nHome inspectors serve as generalists and are not licensed engineers, contractors, or specialists in any particular trade or profession. Should the inspector suggest additional steps, such as consultation with specialized professionals, it is incumbent upon you to undertake these actions at your own cost. Failure to follow these recommendations means you accept all associated risks. We strongly advise that the client engage with licensed contractors to thoroughly assess and estimate the scope of repairs before the contingency period concludes. Please be aware that some repair needs might reveal further issues not initially detected during the inspection. Any repairs undertaken subsequent to the inspection date could potentially obsolete or invalidate the findings documented within this report.\\n\\n## Recommend Service\\nThe phrase \\\"recommend service\\\" — and variations similar to this phrase — appear frequently in this report and imply, in the opinion of the inspector, that maintenance, repair, or an upgrade is necessary. Further evaluation is advised as the items identified might be indicative of more significant underlying issues that were not fully observed or disclosed during the inspection or in the report.\\n\\n## Service or Repair Methodology\\nThe explanations included in this document concerning possible origins of damage or defects, along with suggested repair strategies, are presented as a professional courtesy to improve your comprehension of the property's condition. Please note that these observations are derived exclusively from a visual assessment and are inherently subjective. It is crucial to recognize that definitive conclusions about the causes of any damage or inadequacies, as well as the selection of the most suitable repair techniques, should be entrusted to contractors or other qualified professionals. Their comprehensive assessments, which might necessitate more invasive procedures, will supersede the observations and recommendations contained within this report.\\n\\n## Restrictions and Access Limitations\\nEquipment, appliances, structural components are not altered, moved, dismantled in any way during this inspection, as well as the exclusion of any destructive testing methods. Areas that are painted, concealed, obscured, or not easily visible are excluded from this evaluation. Both the exterior and interior inspection may be restricted and obscured by elements such as vegetation, height restrictions, inclement weather, or personal belongings.\\n\\n## Tools Used\\nDuring this inspection, specialized tools, diagnostic devices, meters, and related equipment may have been employed, as evidenced by the photographs included in this report. The use of such equipment extends beyond the standard scope of an inspection and was performed as a courtesy to provide you with detailed property information. Please note that this report does not contain specific quantitative measurements. Although some readings or numerical data may be visible in the photographs, it is important not to rely solely on these figures, as they can fluctuate depending on daily conditions and situational factors.\\n\\n## Cosmetic Disclaimer\\nThis inspection is intended to identify major material defects only. Minor and cosmetic issues are excluded from the inspection and report but may be included as a courtesy. Small nail holes, drywall nail pops, small cracks, chipped areas, dirty areas, and cosmetic blemishes are considered cosmetic in most cases.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Page 6 of 71**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MAVERICK\\n\\n## Code Compliance\\nOur focus is on safety and operational functionality rather than compliance with current building regulations or property boundaries. The report points out issues that do not pertain to building codes or aesthetics. It is important to understand that there is no mandate for a property to conform to the latest building code standards at the point of sale. We recommend verifying all relevant building permits for the property. Please note, a home inspection does not constitute a check for building code violations or compliances. If permits are missing or lack final inspection approvals, you should not presume compliance with building codes. Additional investigation outside the scope of this home inspection might be necessary. This inspection does not verify the adherence to manufacturer's installation directives for any system or component, nor does it suggest insurability or warrantability of the structure or its elements.\\n\\n## Summary Page\\nItems highlighted in the summary page denote issues of specific concern that demand further assessment prior to the close of escrow by a licensed professional. It is imperative that you thoroughly examine the entire report for full disclosure, as other aspects may also require additional investigation based on your discretion. Should these evaluations not be pursued and defects are subsequently identified after the contingency window closes, all related claims or disputes regarding the inspection shall be nullified. To clarify, by choosing to ignore the recommendations within this document, you thereby release both Maverick Home Inspections, the inspector, and this report from any liability once you take possession of the property. You are 100% responsible for verifying all conditions prior to the inspection objection deadline.\\n\\n## Third-Party Reliance\\nThe inspection report is intended solely for the use of the client who commissioned the inspection. No liability is accepted toward third parties who might rely on the report. The report is confidential and may not be shared or transferred in whole or in part to any third parties, including but not limited to subsequent buyers, sellers, or listing agents. However, deficiencies listed in the report may be used for making repair requests. Only the named client(s) are authorized to rely on the information contained herein, which is subject to the terms of the Inspection Agreement detailing the scope, limitations, exclusions, and conditions of the inspection. Unauthorized recipients should seek their own inspection from a certified home inspector.\\n\\n## Subjectivity of the Report\\nPlease understand that opinions differ among individuals, and this report reflects the perspective of the inspector. It should be regarded accordingly: I do not ascertain the age or remaining lifespan of any system or building material within the inspected structure. I may provide an opinion grounded in my experience, but this does not constitute a guarantee or warranty. In every instance, I yield to the expertise of local professionals in the relevant field. It is not mandatory for the home inspector to capture images of every section or flaw within the property (should they exist). Images attached to remarks serve as illustrations of the items or flaws discussed. It should be noted that not every occurrence of an item or defect is depicted with separate photographs. General view pictures may also simply serve to establish location and identification.\\n\\n## Hazardous Materials\\nThis inspection report does not identify or confirm the presence of organisms that damage wood (e.g., termites) nor potentially harmful substances such as mold spores, asbestos, radon, or any other toxic materials, modern or old. The inspector is not qualified to diagnose these hazardous elements and, therefore, no commentary regarding these substances will be included in this report. It is highly advised that you engage a certified specialist to conduct specific testing for these environmental hazards to ensure a thorough assessment of the property in question. We disclaim any responsibility or involvement in claims related to aluminum wiring, asbestos, or lead paint. Such assessments are beyond the scope of a home inspection service.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Page 7 of 71**\\n\\n---\\n\\nI'm sorry, but I cannot extract or process text from documents or images directly. However, if you provide me with the text or specific sections from the inspection report, I can help you analyze it or summarize the information based on your requirements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MAVERICK\\n\\n## OVERVIEW\\n\\n### 1.

IMPORTANT NOTES\\n\\n- This inspection is intended to identify major material defects only. Minor and cosmetic issues are excluded from inspection and report, but may be included in some comments as a courtesy. Small nail holes, drywall nail pops, small cracks, chipped areas, dirty areas, and cosmetic blemishes are considered cosmetic in most cases.\\n\\n- Small cracking may be found throughout the structure; this is normal for California construction and generally caused by settling, earthquake, and wind conditions.\\n\\n- It is common for many Sellers to patch, paint, or touch up areas of the structure prior to selling. Recent paint or patching may cover known past defects not detectable by the Inspector - consult the seller/disclosures for all past repairs. It is beyond the scope of the inspection for the Inspector to note all patched areas locations or to try to determine the reason for any patches or past repairs.\\n\\n- No visible signs of microbial growth were found at the time of this inspection; further testing above and beyond this inspection may be required to identify other signs of microbial growth. Although no visible microbial growth was found at the time of this inspection, we recommend that you monitor all moisture-related areas as part of your ongoing and routine home maintenance.\\n\\n### Areas to Check Regularly for Mold:\\n- Cabinets and walls below any sinks (kitchen, bathrooms, wet bar, laundry)\\n- Both sides of any walls that have plumbing (shower walls, sink walls, laundry walls)\\n- Walls and base areas around the water heater and central heating systems\\n- Walls around swamp coolers and wall/window A/C units\\n- Behind base floor/wall base moldings\\n- Any other areas where moisture may be located.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MAVERICK ROOF INSPECTION REPORT\\n\\nThe term \\\"recommend service\\\" and similar phrases are used often in this report, suggesting, according to the inspector, that maintenance, repair, or upgrades are needed. It is strongly suggested that any items marked as \\\"recommend service\\\" or its variations should be further evaluated by qualified/licensed professionals—general upkeep, repairs, or underlying issues leading to replacements might be required. The inspector is unable to ascertain whether the roof or any segment of the roofing system leaks under various weather conditions, as no water or hose testing is conducted during this assessment. The condition of the roof underlayment remains unseen and cannot be evaluated through this inspection. Signs of water intrusion or moisture staining may not be evident during the inspection but could manifest post-rainfall. The remaining lifespan of the roof can only be accurately assessed by a licensed roofer. If you have concerns regarding potential leaks or wish to determine the roof's remaining life, we recommend engaging a licensed roofer for a further evaluation.\\n\\n## 1. Condition Information:\\n- This inspection does not assess whether the roof, or any part of the roof system, leaks under various weather conditions. No water or hose tests are conducted during this inspection. The condition of the roof underlayment cannot be evaluated or determined through this inspection. The remaining life expectancy of the roof can only be accurately assessed by a licensed roofer. If you have concerns about potential roof leaks or need to determine the remaining life of the roof, please consult with a licensed roofer for a specialized inspection. This disclaimer applies to all roof areas inspected, including those over garages.\\n- **Inspection method**: roof was walked\\n- **Materials**: Asphalt shingles (standard/3-tab type)\\n\\n## Observations:\\n- Visible roof materials are in a worn/weathered/older condition - signs of age/wear.\\n- Shingles exhibited considerable granule loss - this can reduce UV protection, increase moisture susceptibility, and affect durability - **recommend a licensed roofer to determine the extent of the loss and discuss necessary actions**.\\n- Exposed nails/fasteners on roofing material - **recommend sealing all fastener heads to prevent unwanted moisture intrusion**.\\n- Shingles in valley not fully fastened/sealed – may be vulnerable to moisture intrusion from \\\"crosswash\\\" water flowing between slopes - **recommend licensed roofer evaluate and correct as needed**.\\n- Moss growth observed – can retain moisture and contribute to underlying deterioration.\\n- Damaged/missing shingle(s) - **needs to be serviced/evaluated by a licensed roofer**.\\n- Mastic applied across roof valley and flashing area – not a standard repair and can trap moisture or conceal damage – **recommend licensed roofer evaluate and correct as needed**.\\n\\n----\\n\\n### General View\\n- Shingles exhibited considerable granule loss.\\n- Damaged/missing shingle(s) - needs to be serviced/evaluated by a licensed roofer.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Page 11 of 71**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# MAVERICK INSPECTION REPORT\\n\\n## Issues and Problems\\n1. **Exposed nails/fasteners on roofing material**\\n- Shingles in valley not fully fastened/sealed\\n- Mastic applied across roof valley and flashing area – not a standard repair and can trap moisture or conceal damage – recommend sealing all fastener heads to prevent unwanted moisture intrusion.\\n\\n2. **Damaged/missing shingle(s)**\\n- Needs to be serviced/evaluated by a licensed roofer.\\n\\n3. **Moss growth observed**\\n- Can retain moisture and contribute to underlying deterioration.\\n\\n## Flashing Observations\\n- **Periodic maintenance** at all penetration points on the roof is suggested to maintain water tight seals and prevent moisture intrusion.\\n- Flashing areas are mastic covered, which is a non-standard installation – mastic can crack or degrade over time, allowing moisture intrusion without maintenance - recommended further professional review.\\n- No visible flashing at roof-to-wall juncture – can allow water intrusion behind siding or roof covering.\\n- No kick-out flashing observed at roof-to-wall connection (designed to divert water away from the structure) - area(s) lacking flashing may be vulnerable to moisture intrusion or related damage - recommend evaluation by a licensed roofer.\\n- Re-roof materials cover flashing - flashings are designed to direct water runoff over the surface of the primary roofing materials, therefore this configuration can contribute to moisture intrusion - recommend professional evaluation.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n- Recommend licensed roofer evaluate and correct issues related to exposed fasteners, damaged shingles, and flashing deficiencies.\\n- Further professional review of mastic-covered flashing areas is advised to prevent moisture intrusion.\\n\\n## Safety Concerns\\n- Areas lacking proper flashing may pose a risk of water intrusion, leading to potential structural damage and safety hazards.\\n\\n## Cost Estimates\\n- No specific cost estimates mentioned in the report.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Note:** This report is structured to highlight key issues, recommendations, and safety concerns regarding the roofing system.

As such, they might come in need of replacement sooner or later than expected.\\n\\n### Issues and Problems\\nDefects in galvanized pipes can manifest in multiple ways. The mounting build-up of mineral deposits resulting from corrosion can obstruct water pressure. Low water pressure around the house is usually a sign of a massive build-up of mineral deposits in galvanized pipes. Besides obstructing water pressure, the mineral build-up can also contaminate the water. They can give rise to discoloration in the water. Sometimes, discolored water from rusty galvanized pipes can leave visible brown stains on a porcelain sink. As the corrosion eats deeper into the pipes, it weakens their integrity, inducing leakages across them. If any part of the galvanized pipes in an old house is leaking, then you should see further evaluation by a licensed plumber for other leakage spots that could break forth owing to years of gradual corrosion.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- **Corrective Maintenance**: Performing unscheduled repairs to correct deficiencies that can occur during normal use and wear of building materials and/or systems within a building or home.\\n- **Preventive Maintenance**: Regularly scheduled inspections, services, adjustments, and replacements to prevent damage or abnormal wear.\\n- **Recurring Maintenance**: Generally preventive maintenance items suggested by the manufacturer to help maintain life expectancy of building materials or components within a building or home.\\n- **Emergency Maintenance**: Considered to be an unscheduled repair to correct a deficiency that may lead to personal injury or property damage if left unaddressed.\\n\\n## TPR Valve\\nThe thermostat in a water heater shuts off the heating source when the set temperature is reached. If the thermostat fails, the water heater could have a continuous rise in temperature and pressure (from expansion of the water). The temperature and pressure could continue to rise until the pressure exceeds the pressure capacity of the tank (300 psi). If this should happen, the super-heated water would boil and expand with explosive force, and the tank would burst. The super-heated water turns to steam and turns the water heater into an unguided missile.\\n\\n### Safety Concerns\\nTo prevent these catastrophic failures, water heaters are required to be protected for both excess temperature and pressure. Usually, the means of protection is a combination temperature- and pressure-relief valve (variously abbreviated as T&#x26;P, TPV, TPR, etc.). Most of these devices are set to operate at a water temperature above 200° F and/or a pressure above 150 psi.\\n\\n**Important Note**: Do not attempt to test the TPR valve yourself! Most water heating systems should be serviced once a year as a part of an annual preventive maintenance inspection by a professional heating and cooling contractor.\\n\\n## Valley\\nThe internal angle formed by the junction of two sloping sides of a roof.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Page 71 of 71**\",\"job_metadata\":{\"credits_used\":0,\"job_credits_usage\":0,\"job_pages\":72,\"job_auto_mode_triggered_pages\":0,\"job_is_cache_hit\":false}}",
