To the best of our knowledge and belief, all statements and information in this report are true and correct.\\n\\nShould any disagreement or dispute arise as a result of this inspection or report, it shall be decided by arbitration and shall be submitted for binding, non-appealable arbitration to the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Arbitration Rules then obtaining, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. In the event of a claim, the Client will allow the Inspection Company to inspect the claim prior to any repairs or waive the right to make the claim. Client agrees not to disturb or repair or have repaired anything which may constitute evidence relating to the complaint, except in the case of an emergency.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## SITE\\n\\nThis inspection is not intended to address or include any geological conditions or site stability information. We do not comment on coatings or cosmetic deficiencies and the wear and tear associated with the passage of time, which would be apparent to the average person. However, cracks in hard surfaces can imply the presence of expansive soils that can result in continuous movement, but this can only be confirmed by a geological evaluation of the soil. Any reference to grade is limited to only areas around the exterior of the exposed areas of foundation or exterior walls. We cannot determine drainage performance of the site or the condition of any underground piping, including subterranean drainage systems and municipal water and sewer service piping or septic systems. Decks and porches are often built close to the ground, where no viewing or access is possible. Any areas too low to enter or not accessible are excluded from the inspection. We do not evaluate any detached structures such as storage sheds and stables, nor mechanical or remotely controlled components such as driveway gates. We do not evaluate or move landscape components such as trees, shrubs, fountains, ponds, statuary, pottery, fire pits, patio fans, heat lamps, and decorative or low-voltage lighting. Any such mention of these items is informational only and not to be construed as inspected.\\n\\n### Site Observations:\\n- **Site Drainage:**\\n- **Condition:** Satisfactory\\n- **Details:** The lot appears to have adequate drainage to prevent water from ponding.

This protects the pipe from settlement stress and corrosion. This is a safety concern.\\n\\n### Piping Installation\\n- **Routing:** Satisfactory - Gas supply piping as installed appears adequate.\\n- **Shutoffs - Hangers - Supports:** A seismic shutoff was located on the gas meter.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## FOUNDATION\\nAll structures are dependent on the soil beneath them for support, but soils are not uniform. Some that appear to be firm and solid can become unstable during seismic activity or may expand with the influx of water, moving structures with relative ease and fracturing slabs and other hard surfaces.\\n\\nIn accordance with our standards of practice, we identify foundation types and look for any evidence of structural deficiencies. However, minor cracks or deteriorated surfaces are common in many foundations and most do not represent a structural problem. If major cracks are present along with bowing, we routinely recommend further evaluation by a qualified structural engineer.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- All exterior grades should allow for surface and roof water to flow away from the foundation.\\n- All concrete floor slabs experience some degree of cracking due to shrinkage in the curing process. In most instances, floor coverings prevent recognition of cracks or settlement in all but the most severe cases.\\n\\n**Note:** Where carpeting and other floor coverings are installed, the materials and condition of the flooring underneath cannot be determined. Areas hidden from view by finished walls or stored items should be evaluated for potential issues.\\n\\n----\\n\\n© TETEAK Home Inspection\\n**Confidential - for client use only.** Use by any unauthorized persons is prohibited.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Home Inspection Report\\n\\n**Date:** March 23, 2025\\n**Address:** 8600 Appian Way\\n**Page:** 10\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Foundation\\n\\n- **Type of Foundation:** Slab on grade - Refers to a concrete slab poured on a prepared gravel or sand base at grade level.\\n- **Foundation Materials:** Poured in place concrete, 8 inches or more thick.\\n\\n### Issues and Problems\\n- No major defects noted, but the inspector recommends consulting with a foundation contractor, structural engineer, or geologist if there are any visible suspicious cracks.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- Inquire with the seller about any prior foundation or structural repairs.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Roof &#x26; Attic\\n\\nThe inspector generally attempts to evaluate various roof types by walking on their surfaces. If unable or unwilling to do this, the method used for evaluation will be indicated.\\n\\n### Issues and Problems\\n- The inspector cannot guarantee whether the roof leaks or may be subject to future leakage. The waterproof membrane beneath roofing materials is generally concealed and cannot be examined without removing the roof material.\\n- Water stains on ceilings or framing within attics do not necessarily confirm an active leak without corroborative evidence.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- Ask the sellers about the roof and its history.\\n- Include comprehensive roof coverage in your home insurance policy or obtain a roof certification from an established local roofing company.\\n- Note that attached accessories including but not limited to solar systems, antennae, and lightning arrestors are not inspected.\\n\\n### Roofing\\n- **Type of Roof:** Flat.\\n- **Additional Notes:** Kitchen vent; tar needed to seal.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**© TETEAK Home Inspection**\\nConfidential - for client use only.

It is 36 inches wide rolled horizontally with at least a 2\\\" overlap. It is installed over a 15# felt paper and generally covered with a granular surface to retard ultraviolet deterioration.\\n\\n### Everywhere Else\\n- **Material:** Elastomeric Roofing\\n- Description: Elastomeric roofing material is generally a flexible, rubber-like material that is laid over the entire roof. It is either glued or laid loose then held in place with water or gravel.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Condition of Roof Covering Material\\n- The roof covering material shows evidence of deterioration or leakage to the degree that action is required to determine the extent of repairs needed. Estimates from licensed professionals are needed. The backed up drain over the living room allowed water entry into the framing. The flashing around the kitchen vent was loose and likely allowed water entry below the elastomeric roof membrane.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Estimated Life Expectancy of Roof\\n- **Rolled Asphalt:** My estimated age of the roof is newer, less than 5 years of age.

The inspector does not light pilot lights or ignite or extinguish solid fuel fires, nor are safety devices tested by the inspector. The inspector is not equipped to inspect furnace heat exchangers for evidence of cracks or holes, or inspect concealed portions of evaporator and condensing coils, heat exchanger or firebox, electronic air filters, humidifiers and de-humidifiers, ducts and in-line duct motors or dampers, as this can only be done by dismantling the unit. This is beyond the scope of this inspection. Thermostats are not checked for calibration or timed functions. Adequacy, efficiency or the even distribution of air throughout a building cannot be addressed by a visual inspection. Have these systems evaluated by a qualified individual. The inspector does not perform pressure tests on coolant systems, therefore no representation is made regarding coolant charge or line integrity. We perform a conscientious evaluation of the system, but we are not specialists.\\n\\n- Please note that even modern heating systems can produce carbon monoxide, which in a poorly ventilated room can result in sickness and even death. Therefore, it is essential that any recommendations we make for service or further evaluation be scheduled before the close of escrow, because a specialist could reveal additional defects or recommend further upgrades that could affect your evaluation of the property, and our service does not include any form or warranty or guarantee. Normal service and maintenance is recommended on a yearly basis. Determining the presence of asbestos materials commonly used in heating systems can ONLY be performed by laboratory testing and is beyond the scope of this inspection. Determining the condition of oil tanks, whether exposed or buried, is beyond the scope of this inspection.\\n\\n----\\n\\n© TETEAK Home Inspection           Confidential - for client use only.

This valve can be used to cut off the water supply to the water heater.\\n\\n### Temperature Controls:\\n- **Condition:** Satisfactory\\n- **Details:** The thermostat and temperature controls appear to function normally.\\n\\n### Drain Valve:\\n- **Status:** Yes\\n- **Details:** There is a drain valve installed on the lower side of the water heater.\\n\\n### Expansion Tank:\\n- **Recommendation:** An expansion tank is needed.\\n- **Details:** This is needed because of being a closed water system and the heated water expanding will need somewhere to go. The pressure regulator on the main water line has created a closed system. Without a pressure regulator on the main water line, the system is open and the water typically ends up expanding back out the cold water inlet, all the way back to the water supply coming into the house. The municipal water supply for the house acts as a gigantic expansion tank. Without an expansion tank on a closed system, the temperature and pressure relief valve at the water heater can start to leak or other problems may show up in the house, such as the toilet fill valves randomly re-filling toilets, or faucets chronically dripping.\\n\\n### Temperature &#x26; Pressure Relief Valve:\\n- **Condition:** Satisfactory\\n- **Details:** The temperature and pressure relief valve is of the correct rating for the water heater.\\n\\n### Safety Overflow Pipe:\\n- **Condition:** Satisfactory\\n- **Details:** The overflow pipe is correctly installed.\\n\\n### Insulated Hot Water Piping:\\n- **Issue:** There is no insulation installed on the exposed water piping in unheated areas.\\n- **Recommendations:** Hot water piping that runs through unheated areas should be insulated to reduce water heating costs and to get hotter water to the fixture quicker. Up to 30% of the heat losses in a domestic hot water system are from the delivery piping system.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Kitchen Inspection\\n\\n### Kitchen Plumbing:\\n- **Faucet and Supply Lines:**\\n- **Condition:** Satisfactory\\n- **Details:** Faucets and supply lines appear satisfactory with no leaks noted. There are shutoffs installed for both hot and cold water pipes under the basin. The dish sprayer attachment is functional.\\n- **Additional Notes:** A water filtration valve was noted, but not connected to any source in the lower cabinet.\\n\\n----\\n\\n© TETEAK Home Inspection    Confidential - for client use only.

Estimates from licensed professionals are needed.\\n- The backed up drain over the living room allowed water entry into the framing.\\n- The flashing around the kitchen vent was loose and likely allowed water entry below the elastomeric roof membrane.\\n\\n2. **Flashing:**\\n- Some portion of the roof flashing needs repair or replacement. At least one of the vent stack flashings needs repair with tar.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## HEATING-VENTILATION-AC\\n\\n### Air Conditioning - Primary Unit:\\n- **Model/Serial Number/Size:**\\n1. The age of the unit is 2008. The typical service life for an AC unit is 12 - 15 years. Although this unit was operational during the inspection, the age and/or condition is such that you may need to replace it in the near future.\\n\\n### Heating Plant - Primary Unit:\\n- **Filter Type/Size:**\\n2. No filter installed. Recommend one be installed.\\n\\n- **Ducts Condition:**\\n3. The ducts appear to have loose taping at seams. Have an air leak that reduces the effectiveness of the heating system. The largest noted leak is in a duct. This inspection includes only the visible portions of the ducts.\\n\\n4. Bio-growth material was noted on the inside of the cover of the air return filter on the roof. It was not known how long the system has been running without being cleaned. Cleaning the interior of the ducts may be beneficial.\\n\\n### Primary Bathroom:\\n- **Ventilation Fans:**\\n5. The exhaust unit has a rattling sound to it. It will need service or replacement.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## PLUMBING\\n\\n### Site:\\n- **Site Drainage:**\\n1. The yard drains were not flood tested and will require cleaning for effective operation. Roof debris was blocking up the downspout. After being cleared, the debris entered the drain, but did not exit to the street.\\n\\n### Utility Services:\\n- **Water Meter Location:**\\n2. There is an active water leak on the side of the DWP and main valve. The DWP will need to make the correction.\\n\\n### Gas Services:\\n- **Secondary Supply Piping:**\\n3. A gas pipe cannot be installed in solid walls, floors, such as concrete and masonry, unless the pipe is in an open chase or in a casing (sleeve). This protects the pipe from settlement stress and corrosion. This is a safety concern.\\n\\n### Air Conditioning - Primary Unit:\\n- **Condensate Line:**\\n4. There is a condensate drain line installed, but attention is recommended so that it will drain the condensate from the evaporator condensate tray into the condensate drain line. The rubber condensate drain hose into the guest bathroom sink drain was kinked and restricting the water flow. Overtime this kink will collect debris and cause backups preventing proper draining. Recommend correction.\\n\\n----\\n\\n© TETEAK Home Inspection    Confidential - for client use only.  Use by any unauthorized persons is prohibited.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Home Inspection Report\\n\\n**Date:** March 23, 2025\\n**Address:** 8600 Appian Way\\n**Page:** 52\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Heating Plant - Primary Unit:\\n- **Fuel Source:**\\n1. There is no drip leg installed on the incoming gas line to the heater unit. **Recommendation:** Installation of a drip leg is recommended to prevent debris from getting into the gas valve.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Plumbing:\\n- **Exterior Hose Bibs Functional:**\\n2. There are no backflow preventer valves installed on all hose bibs. **Recommendation:** It would be a good investment to have them installed.\\n\\n- **Leaks in the Supply Piping Noted:**\\n3. Water supply buried in the slab foundation or the walls/ceiling could not be viewed or determined if any leaks are present. **Recommendation:** Only a qualified plumber can detect this.\\n\\n- **Sewage Disposal Type:**\\n4. Public Sewer System. This inspection merely identifies the type of sewage waste disposal system. It does not comment on the adequacy or effectiveness of the system. **Recommendation:** For further evaluation, a qualified Inspection Company should perform further testing under separate contract and direction.\\n\\n- **Lawn Sprinkler System:**\\n5. There is a lawn sprinkler system installed. The inspection of the installed lawn sprinkler is beyond the scope of this inspection. **Recommendation:** Recommend further inspection by a licensed plumber or lawn sprinkler company. The irrigation control panel is located on the exterior wall, left.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Water Heater:\\n- **Drip Leg Installed for Natural Gas-Fired Unit:**\\n6. No - There is no drip leg installed on the incoming gas line to the water heater. **Recommendation:** Installation of a drip leg is recommended to prevent debris from getting into the gas valve.\\n\\n- **Expansion Tank:**\\n7. An expansion tank is needed. This is needed because of being a closed water system and the heated water expanding will need somewhere to go. The pressure regulator on the main water line has created a closed system. Without a pressure regulator on the main water line, the system is open and the water typically ends up expanding back out the cold water inlet, all the way back to the water supply coming into the house. The municipal water supply for the house acts as a gigantic expansion tank. Without an expansion tank on a closed system, the temperature and pressure relief valve at the water heater can start to leak or other problems may show up in the house, such as the toilet fill valves randomly re-filling toilets, or faucets chronically dripping.\\n\\n- **Insulated Hot Water Piping:**\\n8. There is no insulation installed on the exposed water piping in unheated areas. This is inefficient. **Recommendation:** Hot water piping that runs through unheated areas should be insulated to reduce water heating costs and to get hotter water to the fixture quicker. Up to 30% of the heat losses in a domestic hot water system are from the delivery piping system.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Kitchen Plumbing:\\n- **Faucet and Supply Lines:**\\n9. A water filtration valve was noted, but not connected to any source in the lower cabinet.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Laundry:\\n- **Washer Hookup:**\\n10. The laundry washer should not be installed with rubber hoses. These hoses have a life expectancy of 5 years. These tend to leak/break when least expected and should be installed/replaced with metal flex hoses.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Primary Bathroom:\\n- **Basin and Drain Fixture:**\\n- [Details not provided in the current text]\\n\\n----\\n\\n**© TETEAK Home Inspection**\\nConfidential - for client use only.

The stopper was removed.\\n\\n### Structural - Masonry\\n8. **Retaining Walls**: There does not appear to be adequate drainage along the base of the wall. This may need to be installed. A retaining wall professional should further evaluate this condition.\\n\\n### Environmental\\n9. **Hillside Property**: This residence sits as part of a hillside. A geotechnical inspection of this hillside is not included as part of this inspection and should be performed by a specialist to identify any deficiencies that may affect drainage, soil erosion, retaining walls, foundation, or settling of the structure creating uneven flooring. Any service walk/yard drains should be checked for drainage and may require cleaning.\\n\\n### Kitchen Interior\\n10. **Cabinets, Drawers, and Doors**: Visible bio-growth material (black stains) with a musty scent was noted below the sink. Recommend further investigation by an environmental specialist.\\n\\n### Bedroom #2: Middle\\n11. **Ceiling**: Signs of a previous water leak in the ceiling in this room. It does not appear to be an active leak.\\n\\n### Living Room\\n12. **Walls**: A moisture sensor has identified damp walls below the surface paint. Hidden damage or bio-growth conditions may be present. This will need evaluation by an environmental professional.\\n\\n### Dining Room\\n13. **Ceiling**: [Details not provided in the current text]\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n- **Basin Adjustments**: Adjust or replace the basin stoppers in bathrooms as needed.\\n- **Shower Head Repairs**: Adjust or replace leaking shower heads and apply plumber's tape at connections.\\n- **Faucet Inspection**: Investigate the reduced water flow rate in the bathroom vanity faucet.\\n- **Geotechnical Inspection**: Schedule a geotechnical inspection for the hillside property to assess drainage and soil stability.\\n- **Environmental Investigation**: Engage an environmental specialist to investigate bio-growth material and damp conditions in the kitchen and living room.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Safety Concerns\\n\\n- **Moisture and Bio-Growth**: The presence of damp walls and visible bio-growth material poses potential health risks and should be addressed promptly.\\n- **Hillside Stability**: The stability of the hillside and potential drainage issues could lead to safety hazards if not evaluated by a professional.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## Cost Estimates\\n\\n- **Retaining Wall Evaluation**: Costs for professional evaluation of retaining walls may vary; obtain quotes from local specialists.\\n- **Environmental Specialist**: Costs for environmental assessments will depend on the extent of investigation required.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**© TETEAK Home Inspection**\\n**Confidential - for client use only.

There are signs of a previous water leak in the ceiling in this room. It does not appear to be an active leak.\\n\\n### Garage\\n#### Garage Walls Condition\\n2. There are some conditions in the wall sheeting that need to be repaired. There is evidence of leakage in at least one wall. The stain appears to be from a current leakage. Noted at the side door. Further evaluation is needed by an environmental professional.\\n\\n## General Maintenance\\n\\n### Fences &#x26; Gates\\n#### Fence Materials Condition\\n3. The fencing is not performing its intended function. Repair or replacement is suggested. At least 7 cracked glass/plexi-glass panels were noted and will need replacement.\\n\\n4. The metal fencing is rusted and needs repair or replacement. There were some sharp edges that are a safety concern. Rust stains were noted running down the translucent panel.\\n\\n#### Gates and Latches\\n5. There is some portion of the latch's hardware that is nonfunctional. The latches at the pool equipment need alignment for the gate to latch in the closed position.\\n\\n#### Fence Needed - Aquatic Area\\n6. Current safety requirements call for a minimum of two of the previous seven listed drowning prevention safety features for the pool or spa. This residence did not meet those requirements and will need additional protection of the pool/spa. The following drowning prevention feature was noted: none.\\n\\n### Roofing\\n#### Roof Gutter System\\n7. Debris in gutters needs to be cleaned out now and should be routinely cleaned out to enable proper roof drainage through the downspouts.\\n\\n8. The gutter system on the roof edge has deterioration and rust stains. The portion over the kitchen left side will need replacement.\\n\\n### Structural\\n#### Siding Condition\\n9. **Stucco Observations** - Stucco is a masonry surface material put on in layers over an expanded wire mesh that is fastened to the substrate.\\n**Stucco Cracking** - Stucco cracking, other than hairline cracks, is usually a result of either stress or moisture. These cracks should not be repaired until the source of the cracking can be determined and appropriate action taken. Noted on the overhang at the kitchen exit and over the garage at the studio wall.\\n\\n#### Structural Caulking\\n10. Several spots around the structure were noted that need to be caulked. Caulk should be applied to areas where brick and wood siding meet, trim around window frames or doors, and piping and service penetrations. Also, any cracks that allow moisture or wind entry should be caulked to prevent deterioration.\\n\\n### Fireplace\\n#### Flue Condition from Firebox\\n11. It is beyond the scope of this inspection to determine cracking or damage to the chimney or its flue as a chimney professional can only determine this. I do not physically grab and shake a chimney to determine any structural cracks. If this chimney has not recently been inspected, recommend a qualified chimney inspector examine the entire run of this chimney's flue to identify cracks in mortar/brick or separation at metal seams.\\n\\n### Plumbing\\n#### Fire Sprinkler Installed\\n- [Details not provided in the text]\\n\\n----\\n\\n**© TETEAK Home Inspection**\\nConfidential - for client use only.

At the fire sprinkler controls on the left exterior of the garage, a metal box that supplies spare parts is damaged and needs replacement.\\n\\n2. There are at least two sprinkler caps still with painters tape that needs removal.\\n\\n### Kitchen Plumbing\\n#### Caulking Water Contact Areas\\n3. The caulking in water contact areas appear to need attention. If left unsealed, water can cause costly damage. Staining was noted under the faucet connections.\\n\\n### Kitchen Interior\\n#### Outside Entry Door\\n4. The door self closes or opens. This indicates that the door may have been hung incorrectly or settling has occurred. To fix this condition, remove one of the hinge pins and slightly bend it then re-install it. This should give enough friction to stop the self-closing.\\n\\n5. There was evidence of water entry at the backdoor. Additional sealing at the threshold may be needed.\\n\\n### Laundry\\n#### Dryer Ventilation\\n6. If the laundry dryer duct has not recently been cleaned, it may need cleaning. Lint build-up should be cleaned from around the appliances as it is a fire safety concern. This should be conducted on a routine basis.\\n\\n### Primary Bathroom\\n#### Tub &#x26; Shower Walls\\n7. The tile grout changes color when wet; this indicates that grout sealer has not been applied or not enough coats were applied. Re-applying sealer is recommended every couple of years. This will prevent staining, mildew spores, and any compromising of the tile adhesion. All corners of tile should be inspected annually for cracks at which time silicone caulk should be applied to prevent moisture intrusion.\\n\\n#### Entry Door\\n8. A door stop is needed.\\n\\n#### Windows\\n9. At least one window or associated hardware in this room needs repair. The thermal seal is broken. Although it is keeping the elements out, it has a clouded appearance. This condition will worsen. Noted on both windows.\\n\\n10. Missing crank handle was noted on the smaller window.\\n\\n### Bathroom #2: Hallway\\n#### Basin and Drain Fixture\\n11. The right sink was installed over a partially removed old sink. Sharp edges were present and a complete removal of the old sink is needed.\\n\\n### Bathroom #4: Study/Den Powder\\n#### Caulking/Water Contact Areas\\n12. The caulking in the water contact areas appears to need attention. Damage may result if not corrected.\\n\\n#### Entry Door\\n13. A door stop is needed.\\n\\n14. No privacy lock was noted and should be installed for privacy.\\n\\n#### Windows\\n- [No specific issues listed for windows in this section.]\\n\\n----\\n\\n**© TETEAK Home Inspection**\\nConfidential - for client use only.
