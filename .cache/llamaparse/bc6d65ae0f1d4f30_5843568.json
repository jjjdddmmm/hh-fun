Lennox is no longer in business and some parts are difficult to impossible to obtain, if needed.\\n**Model#** RDI-36\\n\\n| **LENNOX** | **MODEL:** RDI - 36 | **SERIAL NUMBER:** 664u980300 | **FIREPLACE INTENDED USE:** Solid Wood |\\n|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| **APPROVED LISTED COMPONENTS:** | For Use With | Security | |\\n| **CHIMNEY** | | | |\\n| **INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS** | | | |\\n\\n**This fireplace is intended for use with Lennox Model #RDI-36.**\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175**\\n**Page 6 of 15**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## FIREBOX\\n- **Issues and Problems**: The air cooling vents are filled with dust and debris.\\n- **Recommendations**: This should be cleared out with a vacuum.\\n\\n## DAMPER\\n- **Issues and Problems**: A damper is present and functioning correctly at this time.\\n- **Recommendations**: None needed as the damper is functioning properly.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175**\\n**Page 7 of 15**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## LOG GRATE\\n- **Issues and Problems**: The manufacturer-required log grate is missing from this fireplace unit. According to installation and safety guidelines, the original factory-supplied grate is essential for maintaining proper combustion spacing, airflow, and thermal protection within the firebox. Installing the incorrect size or style of grate can result in localized overheating, potentially damaging the fireplace and creating a fire hazard.\\n\\n- **Recommendations**: While it is technically required to use the original manufacturer's log grate, replacement parts may no longer be available. In such cases, it is strongly recommended to have a custom log grate fabricated to closely match the original in size, shape, height, and spacing to preserve proper function and ensure safety. Use of an improperly sized grate is not advised and may void compliance with manufacturer specifications and safety listings.\\n\\n- **Safety Concerns**: The absence of the log grate poses a fire hazard due to potential localized overheating.\\n\\n## GAS SYSTEM\\n- **Recommendations**: It is advised to install a carbon monoxide detector near the fireplace because one of the by-products of fire is carbon monoxide.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175**\\nPage 8 of 15\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## GAS VALVE / GAS LINE\\n\\nI turned the gas valve on and off and it appears to be functional. I don't check for gas leaks. You should refer to a licensed plumber or the gas company for further information about the gas line system.\\n\\n### Issues and Problems\\n- The gas line is not sealed where it enters the firebox. It is supposed to be sealed to the fireplace manufacturer's requirements with fire rated sealant and insulation to mitigate heat transfer to adjacent materials.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- Seal the gas line where it enters the firebox using fire rated sealant and insulation as per the manufacturer's requirements.\\n\\n### Safety Concerns\\n- The lack of sealing on the gas line poses a potential safety hazard due to heat transfer to adjacent materials.\\n\\n### Cost Estimates\\n- No specific repair costs or estimates are mentioned in this section.\\n\\n----\\n\\nCopyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175    Page 9 of 15\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## FACING / SURROUND\\nIt is unknown if the material backing the surround around the firebox opening is constructed with combustible materials; the material is hollow which could be an indication that it is framed. Frequently, framing is combustible wood. This would require opening of surfaces to determine the underlying materials.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: It is recommended to determine if the material around the firebox is combustible and if so, remove it and replace it with non-combustible materials (in accordance with the fireplace manufacturer's installation requirements).\\n\\n- **Issues and Problems**: Hollow surround\\n\\n----\\n\\n## HEARTH EXTENSION\\nThere isn't a delineated hearth extension area in front of the fireplace opening. It is required by code to have a delineated hearth area. The floor surface in front of the fireplace is not combustible; however, I am unable to determine what the underlying materials are in front of the fireplace as this would require opening surfaces.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Ideally, a delineated hearth extension would be installed by a finish contractor in accordance with the fireplace manufacturer's installation specifications.\\n\\n- **Issues and Problems**: Hearth extension not delineated\\n\\n----\\n\\n## SCREEN\\nThe fireplace screen is present; it prevents sparks and embers from escaping the fireplace.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175**\\nPage 10 of 15\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## CHIMNEY\\n\\nThis is a one-story prefabricated metal flue meant for this specific manufactured fireplace - it is inside an enclosure called a chase.\\n\\n**Inspection Date:** 03/20/2025\\n**Time:** 03.19.40 PM\\n\\n### Issues and Problems\\n- There are combustible materials (combustible sealant) in contact with the chimney. Typically, a 2-inch clearance is minimally required from the chimney.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n- It is vitally important that proper clearances between combustible materials and the chimney be obtained per the manufacturer's installation requirements.\\n\\n### Safety Concerns\\n- The presence of combustible sealant in contact with the chimney poses a potential fire hazard.\\n\\n### Cost Estimates\\n- No specific repair costs or estimates were mentioned in the report.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Note:** There wasn't significant movement in the chase when pressure was applied to it.\\n\\n----\\n\\nCopyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175\\nPage 11 of 15\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## Issues and Problems\\n- **Chase Cover Not Ventilated**: The chase cover is not properly ventilated. In the industry, it has been determined that it is advised to have an air gap between the chase cover and the chase.\\n- **Chase Cover Flat**: The chase cover is flat and has dips noted in it. There are stains that are indications of standing water on top of the chase cover. Standing water can result in deterioration over time and could allow moisture intrusion into the chimney chase.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n- It is recommended to install a ventilated chase cover that follows the chimney manufacturer's installation requirements.\\n- It is recommended to have the chase cover modified or replaced to provide a proper slope to shed water off of it.\\n\\n## Safety Concerns\\n- The presence of standing water on the chase cover poses a risk of deterioration and moisture intrusion, which could lead to further structural issues.\\n\\n## Cost Estimates\\n- No specific repair costs or estimates are mentioned in the report.\\n\\n----\\n\\n*Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175*\\n*Page 12 of 15*\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## FLUE\\nThis is a metal flue. It is approximately 16.5 feet tall as measured from the hearth.\\n\\n### Looking up the flue\\nThe flue appeared to be in acceptable condition.\\n\\n## TERMINATION CAP\\nThe termination cap is present.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Copyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175**\\nPage 13 of 15\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n## Issues and Problems\\n- A decorative shroud has been installed at the top of the chimney. This arrangement can prevent the proper drafting of the chimney and was not described in the installation manual.\\n- The storm collar is missing, which can allow moisture to enter the chase through the opening between the chase cover and the chimney.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n- A storm collar should be installed to prevent moisture intrusion.\\n\\n## Safety Concerns\\n- The installation of the decorative shroud may pose a risk to proper chimney drafting, which can lead to safety hazards.\\n\\n## Cost Estimates\\n- No specific repair costs or estimates were mentioned in the report.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Note**: This report is part of a larger document and is subject to copyright © 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# The Martin Report\\n8600 Appian Way\\nLos Angeles, California 90046\\nThursday, March 20, 2025\\n\\n----\\n\\n## FLASHING\\nRoof flashings are not part of my inspection - you should refer to a licensed roofer for further information about the condition of the roof around the chimney.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## SUMMARY\\nThe recommended repairs must be performed before the fireplace is used, as the observed issues affect the safety and use of the fireplaces.\\n\\nYou should anticipate estimates in the range of **$1,500 - $2,500**, this would not include costs to install the finish surfaces around the fireplace or any other peripheral costs.\\n\\nThere are areas and aspects of the fireplace and chimney that are not viewable without opening or cleaning surfaces and these areas were not viewed or evaluated. During repairs, if other flaws are observed they should be corrected as well. The servicing and repairs should be done during escrow to allow for changes to the anticipated scope of work. It is more common than not to discover other flaws, sometimes significant, when the chase is accessed.\\n\\nThe above prices are provided as a guideline and could well vary from a contractor's estimate intending to perform the scope of work and/or the final costs. A full estimate from a licensed contractor should be obtained as part of the escrow process, for comparison and clarity.\\n\\nA full permit search may reveal information that could affect the findings of this report. It is outside the scope of this inspection to procure and evaluate permit information.\\n\\nThank you for using our services.\\n\\nRespectfully,\\nBraeden Carl\\n\\nCopyright© 2010-2025, SPECTACULAR, Chimney Doctor, Braeden Carl 398877175\\nPage 15 of 15\",\"job_metadata\":{\"credits_used\":0,\"job_credits_usage\":0,\"job_pages\":0,\"job_auto_mode_triggered_pages\":0,\"job_is_cache_hit\":true}}",
