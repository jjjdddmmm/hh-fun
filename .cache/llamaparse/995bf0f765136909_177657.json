The main sewer line is the portion of the waste drainage piping system outside the structure that carries the waste out to the city sewer. Inspection does not include any part of a water supply system or drainage pipes in and under the structure unless used to access the main sewer line. We will inform you on what we discover at time of service. Our findings are based on what is visible and observable with the camera. We give an overall evaluation of the condition of the main line based on our camera's video along with the inspector's knowledge.\\n\\n----\\n\\n### Other Comments\\nEntered mainline via 4\\\" ABS plastic ground clean out located back of house. Mainline continues as ABS plastic pipe from clean out headed south under slab middle bathroom for a few feet turns east under slab house, courtyard where kitchen and front bathroom combine then under garage slab floor into driveway at 65'ft where there is a 3\\\" ABS plastic ground clean out, mainline transitions to 6\\\" CIPP (cured in place pipe) liner then continues under street to 83'ft where it ties into a partially lined saddle/main city tie-in.\\n\\nThe property owner is responsible for the mainline out to the city tie-in.\\n\\n----\\n\\n### Findings\\n- **ABS PLASTIC PIPE VIEWED FROM BACK OF HOUSE TO DRIVEWAY**:\\nFound the ABS plastic pipe viewed from clean out located back of house, slab house, courtyard and garage slab floor to currently be in good condition.\\n\\n- **Accessibility Issue**:\\nThere is a 1 1/2\\\" ABS plastic clean out located under master bathroom lavatory sink that needs to be made accessible.\\n\\n- **6\\\" CIPP (CURED IN PLACE PIPE) LINER UNDER DRIVEWAY AND STREET TO SADDLE**:\\nFound the 6\\\" CIPP (cured in place pipe) liner located under driveway and street to a partially lined saddle to currently be in satisfactory condition. Satisfactory condition due to liner appears to be an older liner. Liners typically have an approximately 10-year warranty; not sure how old this liner is.\\n\\n----\\n\\n### Summary\\n- **Issues and Problems**:\\n- Accessibility issue with the 1 1/2\\\" ABS plastic clean out under the master bathroom lavatory sink.\\n\\n- **Recommendations**:\\n- Make the 1 1/2\\\" ABS plastic clean out accessible.\\n\\n- **Safety Concerns**:\\n- No specific safety concerns noted in the report.\\n\\n- **Cost Estimates**:\\n- No repair costs or estimates mentioned in the report.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThis concludes the inspection report.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Sewer Inspection Report\\n\\n## Issues and Problems\\n- The CIPP mainline should never be cleaned with cable &#x26; blades rooter service as this will damage the CIPP liner installation. For drain cleaning, a hydro-jet (high pressure water with root cutting nozzles) must be used.\\n- Found the partially lined saddle/main city tie-in under the street to currently be in satisfactory condition. However, the liner portion of the saddle appears to be older.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n- Any costs given in this section are approximate estimates and not guaranteed costs. Seek a licensed contractor for any recommended work necessary based on findings. It is advisable to obtain permits and any other documentation relevant to the plumbing system and its individual parts. Recommended work should be done prior to the close of escrow unless otherwise stated in the report.\\n\\n1. **Clean Out Accessibility**:\\n- Recommend making the 1 1/2\\\" ABS plastic clean out located under the master lavatory sink accessible for the time of rooter service and to perform a video inspection of the master bathroom.\\n- **Approximate Cost**: $140.\\n\\n2. **Bathroom Clean Out**:\\n- Did not see an accessible clean out for the bathroom near the kitchen. If there is an accessible clean out, make it accessible at the time for rooter service; if not, install one.\\n- **Approximate Cost**: $1,100 to $1,500.\\n\\n3. **Video Inspection**:\\n- Recommend video inspection from both bathrooms mentioned above once clean outs are made accessible or installed.\\n- **Approximate Cost**: $225.\\n\\n- Contact JP at John White Plumbing and Rooter for further assistance and actual cost to do work.
