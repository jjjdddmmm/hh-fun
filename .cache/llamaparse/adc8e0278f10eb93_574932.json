You should verify the applicable local government requirements at the time of application for a building permit.\\n**Authority:** Health and Safety Code Section 18942(b)\\n**Reference:** Health and Safety Code Section 18942(b): Chapter 925, Statutes of 1996\\n\\n### AV100.1 Definitions.\\nAs used in this division, the following terms have the following meanings:\\n- **ANSI/APSP PERFORMANCE STANDARD** means a standard that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals (APSP).\\n- **APPROVED SAFETY POOL COVER** means a manually or power-operated safety pool cover that meets all of the performance standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), in compliance with Standard F1346-91.\\n- **ENCLOSURE** means a fence, wall or other barrier that isolates a swimming pool from access to the home.\\n- **EXIT ALARMS** means devices that make audible, continuous alarm sounds when any door or window that permits access from the residence to the pool area, that is without any intervening enclosure, is opened or is left ajar. Exit alarms may be battery operated or may be connected to the electrical wiring of the building.\\n- **PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL** means a swimming pool operated for the use of the general public with or without charge, or for the use of the members and guests of a private club. Public swimming pool does not include a swimming pool located on the grounds of a private single-family home.\\n- **SWIMMING POOL or POOL** means any structure intended for swimming or recreational bathing that contains water over 18” (457 mm) deep. Swimming pool includes in-ground and above-ground structures and includes, but is not limited to, hot tubs, spas, portable spas and nonportable wading pools.\\n**Authority:** Health and Safety Code Section 18942(b)\\n**Reference:** Health and Safety Code Section 115921; Chapter 925, Statutes of 1996, Chapter 679, Statutes of 2012.\\n\\n### AV100.2 Construction permit; safety features required.\\n(a) Except as provided in Section AV100.5, when a building permit is issued for the construction of a new swimming pool or spa or the remodeling on an existing swimming pool or spa at a private single-family home, the respective swimming pool or spa shall be equipped with at least two of the following seven drowning prevention safety features:\\n1. An enclosure that meets the requirements of Section AV100.3 and isolates the swimming pool or spa from the private single-family home.\\n2. Removable mesh fencing that meets American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Specifications F2286 standards in conjunction with a gate that is self-closing and self-latching and can accommodate a key lockable device.\\n3. An approved safety pool cover, as defined in Section AV100.1.\\n4. Exit alarms on the private single-family home’s doors that provide direct access to the swimming pool or spa. The exit alarm may cause either an alarm noise or a verbal warning, such as repeating notification that “the door to the pool is open”.\\n5. A self-closing, self-latching device with a release mechanism placed no lower than 54” (1372 mm) above the floor on the private single-family home’s doors providing direct access to the swimming pool or spa.\\n6.

The alarm shall meet and be independently certified to the ASTM Standard F2208 “Standard Safety Specification for Residential Pool Alarms,” which includes surface motion, pressure, sonar, laser and infrared type alarms. A swimming protection alarm feature designed for individual use, including an alarm attached to a child that sounds when the child exceeds a certain distance or becomes submerged in water, is not a qualifying drowning prevention safety feature.\\n7. Other means of protection, if the degree of protection afforded is equal to or greater than that afforded by any of the features set forth above and has been independently verified by an approved testing laboratory as meeting standards for those features established by the ASTM or the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).\\n(b) Before the issuance of a final approval for the completion of permitted construction or remodeling work, the local building code official shall inspect the drowning safety prevention features required by this section and, if no violations are found, shall give final approval.\\n**Authority:** Health and Safety Code Section 18942(b)\\n**Reference:** Health and Safety Code Section 115922; Chapter 925, Statutes of 1996; Chapter 478, Statutes of 2006; Chapter 670, Statutes of 2017.\\n\\n### AV100.3 Enclosure: required characteristics.\\nAn enclosure shall have all of the following characteristics:\\n1.
